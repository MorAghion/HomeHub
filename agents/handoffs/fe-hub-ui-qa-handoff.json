  "summary": "Three hub UI fixes: (1) VouchersHub empty state now uses the static Gift icon instead of a dynamic lookup. (2) Both VouchersHub and ReservationsHub edit mode cards now use the same inline pattern as ShoppingHub/TasksHub — checkbox left, content center, trash right — replacing floating absolute-positioned circles. (3) Bulk action bar in both hubs now uses the burgundy primary color for the delete button and always shows a Cancel button, matching Shopping/Tasks.",
