  "root_cause": "Unknown — after fe-bug-006 fix (async modal close), clicking a list option (e.g. Ontopo, BuyMe) in the 'add new list' menu now does nothing at all. Expected behavior: selecting an option should open the relevant add-voucher or add-reservation details modal. Was working correctly in MVP.",
  "steps_to_reproduce": [
    "1. Log in to the app",
    "2. Navigate to Vouchers hub (or Reservations hub)",
    "3. Tap the add / create new list button",
    "4. Menu appears with list template options (e.g. Ontopo, BuyMe, etc.)",
    "5. Tap any option",
    "6. Nothing happens — no modal opens, menu stays open or closes silently"
