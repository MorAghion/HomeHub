  "description": "In VouchersHub and ReservationsHub, clicking a template option in the 'New List' modal does nothing — the modal stays open and no list is created. This is a regression from the fe-bug-006 fix which changed handleTemplateSelect to await onCreateList and only close the modal on success.",
  "steps_to_reproduce": [
    "1. Navigate to Vouchers hub",
    "2. Click the + (New Voucher List) button",
    "3. Template selection modal opens",
    "4. Click any template (e.g. BuyMe)",
