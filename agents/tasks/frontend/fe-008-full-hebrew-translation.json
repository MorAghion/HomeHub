  "description": "Audit every screen, modal, drawer, and component in the app for untranslated or hardcoded strings. Every piece of user-facing text must support Hebrew via i18n. This is a comprehensive sweep — not just new additions but the entire existing codebase.",
  "scope": [
    "All pages and route-level screens",
    "All modals (confirmation dialogs, detail modals, create/edit forms)",
    "All drawers (MasterListDrawer, etc.)",
    "All hub components (ShoppingHub, TasksHub, VouchersHub, etc.)",
    "All card components (VoucherCard, ReservationCard, TaskCard, etc.)",
    "All form components (create, edit, delete confirmation)",
    "All empty states and loading states",
    "All error messages and toast notifications",
    "All button labels, placeholders, and aria labels",
    "AuthScreen — sign in, sign up, join household flows",
    "SettingsModal — all sections",
    "Navigation labels and hub titles"
  ],
  "approach": [
    "1. Run: grep -r 'className\\|return\\|<' src/components src/pages --include='*.tsx' to find hardcoded strings",
    "2. For each component: identify all visible strings not wrapped in t()",
    "3. Add missing keys to src/i18n/en/{namespace}.json",
    "4. Add Hebrew translations to src/i18n/he/{namespace}.json",
    "5. Replace hardcoded strings with t('namespace:key') calls",
    "6. Use existing namespaces where appropriate: common, shopping, tasks, vouchers, reservations, settings",
    "7. Create new namespaces only if needed (e.g. auth)"
  ],
  "conventions": [
    "No hardcoded user-facing strings in JSX — all through t()",
    "Pluralization via i18next _one/_other keys where needed",
    "RTL-safe — logical Tailwind properties only (ms-, me-, ps-, pe-)",
    "Do not translate: brand names (BuyMe, Ontopo), technical strings, console logs"
  ],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Zero hardcoded user-facing strings in any component",
    "All i18n/he/ files have a matching key for every i18n/en/ key",
    "App fully usable in Hebrew — no English strings visible when language is set to Hebrew",
    "No regressions in English mode",
    "npm run build passes clean"
  ],
  "open_questions": [],
  "completion_summary": "",
  "notes": "fe-bug-003 through fe-bug-015 are resolved and merged. This task is READY TO START. Pay special attention to hardcoded strings in src/utils/contextMapping.ts, src/utils/he/contextMapping.ts, src/utils/suggestions.ts, src/utils/contextResolver.ts — these contain listCategory values and category display strings that are rendered in the UI but may not go through t(). Also audit AddVoucherModal, AddReservationModal, VouchersHub, ReservationsHub — these were recently added and may have untranslated strings. See fe-009 for the companion task covering data-driven category/listCategory values specifically."
