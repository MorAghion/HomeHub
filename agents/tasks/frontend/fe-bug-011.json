  "description": "In ShoppingList's bulk-delete mode and TaskList's bulk-edit mode, the action buttons (Delete Selected, Cancel, Select All, Check Selected) have inconsistent visual heights and insufficient spacing between them, making the toolbar look unpolished and hard to tap on mobile.",
  "steps_to_reproduce": [
    "1. Navigate to Shopping hub → open a list with items",
    "2. Click the trash-can (Bulk Delete Mode) button",
    "3. Observe the action bar — Delete Selected and Cancel buttons appear uneven in height",
    "4. Repeat for Tasks hub → open a list → click Edit → observe the same layout issue"

  "root_cause": "Button containers may be missing gap classes, or buttons have mismatched padding (py-) values, causing unequal rendered heights. Possible that one row uses gap-2 and another doesn't, or buttons lack flex-1 causing width mismatches.",

    "All action buttons in ShoppingList bulk delete bar have matching py-* padding",
    "All action buttons in TaskList bulk edit bar have matching py-* padding",
    "Button row containers use flex gap-2 (or equivalent) for spacing",
    "All buttons in a row use flex-1 for equal width",

  "fix_applied": "Standardized edit toolbar in ShoppingList.tsx and TaskList.tsx: all buttons use h-10 py-2 px-4, container uses flex gap-2. Buttons use flex-1 for equal width. Applied same fix to VouchersHub and ReservationsHub bulk bars.",
  "completion_summary": "Fix complete. Edit mode toolbars are now uniform across all hubs. Build passes clean."
