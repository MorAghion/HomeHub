  "description": "Test all components and pages in RTL Hebrew mode. Verify no visual regressions in LTR English mode. IMPORTANT: This task is partially TDD — fe-008 and fe-009 (full Hebrew translation audit) are running in parallel and may not be complete when qa-007 starts. For components that are still WIP (not yet fully translated), write the tests anyway as TDD — they will fail now and pass once FE finishes. Do NOT skip or defer tests because a component is untranslated. Write the spec, mark it clearly with a comment like '// TDD: awaiting fe-008/fe-009 completion', and let it fail. This gives FE a clear target.",
